## Introduction

The main goal of this project is to provide a RESTful API capable of shortening URLs. Additionally, it is also possible to customize characters and view the number of accesses to a shortened URL.

## Features

- URL shortening.
- Viewing the number of accesses to the URL.
- Integration with MySQL database.
- Documentation of each endpoint using Swagger.

## Technologies

- ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-17-orange): Programming language.
- ![Spring Boot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spring%20Boot-3-green): Framework used for building applications.
- ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-Database-blue): Relational database.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project on your machine (Docker installation required):
