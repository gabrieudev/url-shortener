## Introduction

The main goal of this project is to provide a RESTful API capable of receiving a URL, storing it in a database, and redirecting to the original URL when called. Additionally, the project implements authentication with JWTs and authorization through roles for users, using the best and most up-to-date practices to ensure the integrity of sensitive data.

## Features

- User login and registration.
- Email confirmation for registration.
- URL shortening.
- Subscription plan selection for non-expiring URLs.
- View the number of accesses to the URL.
- Integration with MySQL database.
- Documentation of each endpoint using Swagger.
